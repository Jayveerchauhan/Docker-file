# üìÑ Dockerfile Guide

## ‚úÖ What is a Dockerfile?

A **Dockerfile** is a simple text file that has instructions to help Docker build a container image of your application.

Think of it like a **recipe**: it tells Docker what to do ‚Äî like which software to use, what files to copy, and how to run your app.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Create a Dockerfile

Follow these steps to create a Dockerfile:

1. Go to your project folder.
2. Create a new file and name it exactly `Dockerfile` (with no file extension).
3. Add the following instructions to describe how Docker should build your app.

## üìÇ Example: Dockerfile for a Python App

Here‚Äôs a simple Dockerfile you can use if you have a Python app named `app.py` and a `requirements.txt` file for dependencies.

``dockerfile
# Step 1: Use an official Python image from Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy all files from your project folder into the container
COPY . /app

# Step 4: Install required Python packages
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Tell Docker how to run your app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
